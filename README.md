# eCFR-analyzer

- https://www.ecfr.gov/developers/documentation/api/v1#/
    - In order to create the point-in-time features of the eCFR we process these XML files into smaller units that we then track over time. Our APIs provide access to these various transformations and generated metadata as well as historical search.

	- word count per agency
	- historical changes over time. 
	- Feel free to add your own custom metrics.
- There should be a front end visualization for the content where we can click around
- ideally query items
